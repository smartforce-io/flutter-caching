# flutter caching test

This app shows how to cache data into File. 

Only works for mobile devices (now web).

Next stage will be caching data into database (SQLite). Hopefully it will support web as well.

To run program:
- ```git clone https://github.com/smartforce-io/flutter-caching.git```
- open "flutter-caching" folder in IDE
- ```flutter pub get``` (to install all dependencies)
- choose a device
- run "main.dart" in debug mode
